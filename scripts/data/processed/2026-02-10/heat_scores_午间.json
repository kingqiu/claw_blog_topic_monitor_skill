          "content": "<p>If you call a wait function like <code>Wait­For­Single­Object</code> and receive the code <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code>, what does it mean and what should you do?</p>\n<p>The documentation says that <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code> means that you successfully claimed a mutex, but the thread that previously owned the mutex failed to release the mutex before it exited. This could be an oversight because the code encountered a code path that forgot to release the mutex. Or it could be because the thread crashed before it could release the mutex.</p>\n<p>The documentation also suggests that &#8220;If the mutex was protecting persistent state information, you should check it for consistency.&#8221; This is to handle the second case: The thread crashes before it can release the mutex. If the purpose of the mutex was to prevent other threads from accessing the data while it is in an inconsistent state, then the fact that the thread crashed while holding the mutex means that the data might still be in that inconsistent state.</p>\n<p>Now, maybe you have no way to check whether the data is in an inconsistent state or have no way to repair it if such an inconsistent state is discovered. (Most people don&#8217;t bother to design their data structures with rollback or transactions, because the point of the mutex was to avoid having to write that fancy code in the first place!) In that case, you really have only two choices.</p>\n<p>One option is to just cover your ears and pretend you didn&#8217;t hear anything. Just continue operating normally and hope that any latent corruption is not going to cause major problems.</p>\n<p>Another option is to give up and abandon the operation. However, if that&#8217;s your choice, you have to give up properly.</p>\n<p>The abandoned state is not sticky; is reported only to the <i>first</i> person to wait for the mutex after it was abandoned. Subsequent waits succeed normally. Therefore, if you decide, &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s corrupted, I&#8217;m not touch",

I write things on a git branch, made with the <code>git</code> CLI, then I add them with <code>git add --patch</code> to that branch, trying to run all of the possible linting and tests with <code>git hooks</code> before I waste my time on GitHub Actions. Then I run <code>git up</code> which is an alias to <code>pull --rebase --autostash</code>. Finally I successfully commit, then I copy paste the URL returned by GitHub to open a PR. Then I merge the PR and run <code>git ma</code> to go back to the primary branch, which is an alias to <code>ma = &quot;!f() {git checkout $(git primary) &amp;&amp;git pull;}; f&quot;</code>.</p><p>This workflow, I think, is pretty familiar for anyone working with GitHub a lot. Now you&apos;ll notice I&apos;m not saying <code>git</code> because almost nothing I&apos;m doing has anything to do with <code>git</code>. There&apos;s no advantage to my repo being local to my machine, because everything I need to actually merge and deploy code lives on GitHub. The CI runs there, the approval process runs there, the monitoring of the CI happens there, the injection of secrets happens there. If GitHub is down my local repo does, effectively, nothing. </p><p>My source of truth is always remote, which means I pay the price for <code>git</code> complexity locally but I don&apos;t benefit from it.

My favorite is the one in the TV show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)\">The Expanse</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you watch The Expanse, the most advanced technology is, of course, the Epstein drive (an unfortunate name in this day and age). In their universe, humanity can travel to distant planets, the Belt, and Mars. Mars has the most high-tech military, which is incredibly cool. But the AI is still what impresses me most. If you watched the show, you're probably wondering what the hell I'm talking about right now. Because there is no mention of AI ever. The AI is barely visible. In fact, it's not visible at all. Most of the time, there aren't even voices. Instead, their computer interfaces respond directly to voice and gesture commands without returning any sass.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In Season 1, Miller (the detective) is trying to solve a crime. Out of the blue, he just says, \"Plot the course the Scopuli took over the past months.\" The course is plotted right there in his living room. No fuss, no interruptions, no \"OK Google.\" And when he finally figures it out, no one says \"You are absolutely right!\"</p>\n\n<p>He then interacts with the holographic display in real time, asking for additional information and manipulating the data with gestures. At no point does he anthropomorphize the AI. It's always there, always available, always listening, but it never interrupts. </p>\n\n<p>This type of interaction is present throughout the series. In the Rocinante, James Holden will give commands like \"seal bulkhead,\" \"plot intercept course,\" or \"scan for life signs,\" and the ship's computer simply executes. There are no loading screens, no chatbot personality trying to be helpful. The computer doesn't explain what it's doing or ask for confirmation on routine tasks. It just works.</p>\n\n<p>When Holden needs tactical information during a firefight, he doesn't open an app or navigate menus. He shouts questions, and relevant data appears on his helmet display. When Naomi needs to calculate a complex orbital maneuver, she doesn't fight with an interface. She thinks out loud, and the system provides the calculations she needs.</p>\n\n<p>This is the complete opposite of Microsoft's Copilot... Yes, this is about Copilot.</p>\n\n<p>In Microsoft's vision, they think they're designing an AI assistant, an AI copilot that's always there to help. You have Copilot in Excel, in Edge, in the taskbar. It's everywhere, yet it's as useless as you can imagine.</p>\n\n<p>What is Copilot? Is it ChatGPT or a wrapper around it? Is it a code assistant? Is it a search engine? Or wait, is it all of Microsoft Office now? It's attached to every application, yet it hasn't been particularly helpful. </p>\n\n<p>We now use Teams at work, and I see Copilot popping up every time to offer to help me, just like Clippy. OK, fine, I asked for the meaning of a term I hear often in this company. Copilot doesn't know. Well, it doesn't say it doesn't know. Instead, it gives me the definition of what it thinks the term means in general.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine for a second you're a manager and you hear developers talking about issues with Apache delaying a project. You don't know what Apache is, so you ask Copilot. It tells you that the Apache are a group of Native American tribes known for their resilience in the Southwest. If you don't know any better, you might take that definition at face value, never knowing that Copilot has does not have access to any of the company data. Now in the project retro, you'll blame a native American tribe for delaying the project.</p>\n\n<p>Copilot is everywhere, yet it is nowhere. Nobody deliberately opens it to solve a problem. Instead, it's like Google Plus from back in the day. If you randomly clicked seven times on the web, you would somehow end up with a Google Plus account and, for some reason, two YouTube accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Copilot is visible when it should be invisible, and verbose when it should be silent. It interrupts your workflow to offer help you didn't ask for, then fails to provide useful answers when you actually need them. It's the opposite of the AI in The Expanse. It doesn't fade in the background. It is constantly reminding you that you need to use it here and now.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>The Expanse</em>, the AI doesn't have a personality because it doesn't need one. It's not trying to be your friend or impress you with its conversational abilities. It's a tool, refined to perfection. It is not trying to replace your job, it is there to support you. Copilot only exists to impress you, and it fails at it every single time.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Satya should binge-watch The Expanse. I'm not advocating for AI everything, but I am all for creating useful tools. And Copilot, as it currently exists, is one of the least useful implementations of AI I've encountered.</p>\n\n<p>The best technology is invisible. It doesn't announce itself, doesn't demand attention, and doesn't try to be clever. It simply works when you need it and disappears when you don't. I know Microsoft won't read this or learn from it. Instead, I expect Windows 12 to be renamed Microsoft Copilot OS.</p>\n\n<p>In The Expanse, the AI turn people into heroes. In our world, Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, all want to be the heroes. And they will differentiate themselves by trying to be the loudest.</p>",

Colophon: All the rest. The Epstein class and collapse porn (permalink) It's hard to talk about the Epstein class without thinking about \"The Economy\" &#8211; \"The Economy\" in the sense of a kind of mystical, free-floating entity whose health or sickness determines the outcomes for all the rest of us, whom we must make sacrifices to if we are to prosper. As nebulous as \"The Economy\" is as an entity, there's an economic priesthood that claims it can measure and even alter the course of the economy using complex mathematics. We probably won't ever understand their methods, but we can at least follow an indicator or two, such as changes to GDP, an aggregated statistic that is deceptively precise, given that it subsumes any number of estimates, qualitative judgments and wild-ass guesses, which are all disguised behind an official statistic that is often published to three decimal places. There's plenty to criticize about GDP: a healthy GDP doesn't necessarily mean that the average worker is better off. When your rent goes up, so does GDP. Same with your salary going down (provided this results in more spending by your boss). GDP isn't really a measure of the health of \"The Economy\" &#8211; it's a measure of the parts of \"The Economy\" that make rich people (that is, the Epstein class) better off. But what if there was a way to make money from calamitous collapses in GDP? What if the wealthy didn't just win when \"number go up,\" but also when \"number eat shit?\" The latest batch of Epstein emails includes a particularly ghoulish exchange between Epstein and his business partner, the anti-democracy activist and billionaire Peter Thiel: https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00824843.pdf The email is dated 26 Jun 2016, right after Brexit, and in it, Epstein writes: return to tribalism . counter to globalization. amazing new alliances. you and I both agreed zero interest rates were too high, as i said in your office. finding things on their way to collapse , was much easier than finding the next bargain This is a perfect example of what Naomi Klein calls \"disaster capitalism.\" It's been the norm since the crash of 2008, when bankers were made whole through public bailouts and mortgage holders were evicted by the millions to \"foam the runway\" for the banks: https://wallstreetonparade.com/2012/08/how-treasury-secretary-geithner-foamed-the-runways-with-childrens-shattered-lives/ The crash of 2008 turned a lot of people's homes &#8211; their only substantial possessions &#8211; into \"distressed assets\" that were purchased at fire-sale prices by Wall Street investors, who turned around and rented those homes out to people who were now priced out of the housing market at rents that kept them too poor to ever afford a home, under slum conditions that crawled with insects and black mold: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/01/housing-is-a-human-right/ Note here that economic collapse helps the Epstein class only if society has no social safety net. If Obama had supported homeowners instead of banks, there wouldn't have been a foreclosure crisis and thus there wouldn't have been any \"distressed assets\" flooding the market. So it's no surprise that the Epstein class are also obsessed with austerity. Peter Mandelson (British Labour's \"Prince of Darkness\") is a close ally of Epstein's, and also a key figure in the crushing austerity agenda of Blair, Brown and Starmer. He's a machine for turning Parliamentary majorities into distressed assets at scale. Same for Steve Bannon, another close Epstein ally, who boasts about his alliances with far-right figures who exalt the capital class and call for deregulation and the elimination of public services: Le Pen, Salvini, Farage. Combine that with Epstein and Thiel's gloating about \"finding things on their way to collapse&#8230;much easier than finding the next bargain,\" and it starts to feel like these guys are even happier with \"number eat shit\" than they are with \"number go up.\" Trump is the undisputed king of the Epstein class, and he seems determined to drive \"The Economy\" over a cliff. Take his tariff program, modeled on the McKinley tariffs of 1890, which led to the Panic of 1893, a financial crisis that saw one in four American workers forced into unemployment and 15,000 businesses into bankruptcy (that's a lot of distressed assets!): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893 Then there's Trump's mass deportation program, which will force lots of businesses (farms, restaurants, etc) into bankruptcy, creating another massive pool of distressed assets. Trump's given ICE $75b, while the DoJ Antitrust Division and FTC (which protect Americans from corporate scams) have seen their budgets take a real-terms cut. The majority of DoJ lawyers and FBI agents are working on immigration cases (against workers, not employers, mind!). The Antitrust Division has $275m to fight all of America's corporate crime: https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/white-collar-crime-enforcement-in I'm not saying that Trump is trying to induce another massive economic crash. I'm saying, rather, that within his coalition there is a substantial bloc of powerful, wealthy people who are on the hunt for \"things on their way to collapse,\" and who are doubtless maneuvering to frustrate other Trump coalition members who are solely committed to \"number go up.\" Even the collapse of crypto creates lots of opportunities to \"buy the dip.\" Not the dip in crypto (crypto's going to zero), but the dip in all the real things people bought with real money they got by borrowing against their shitcoins. The thousand-plus children that Epstein lured to his island rape-camp were often \"distressed assets\" in their own right: Julie K Brown's groundbreaking reporting on Epstein for the Miami Herald described how he sought out children whose parents were poor, or neglectful, or both, on the grounds that those children would be \"on their way to collapse,\" too. The Epstein class's commitment to destroying \"The Economy\" makes sense when you understand that trashing civilization is \"much easier than finding the next bargain.\" They want to buy the dip, so they're creating the dip. They don't need the whole number to go up, just theirs. They know that inclusive economies are more prosperous for society as a whole, but it makes criminals and predators worse off. The New Deal kicked off a period of American economic growth never seen before or since, but the rich despised it, because a prosperous economy is one in which it gets harder and harder to find \"things on their way to collapse,\" and thus nearly impossible to \"find[] the next bargain.\" (Image: Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 3.0) Hey look at this (permalink) RIP, Dave Farber
