Go has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">go mod vendor</code>, Cargo has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cargo vendor</code>, and Bundler has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bundle cache</code>.

The alternative was hoping the internet served you the same bytes tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Under Subversion this worked fine. SVN checkouts only pull the current revision of the directories you ask for, leaving everything else on the server. You never download previous versions of vendored files, so a dependency updated twenty times costs you the same as one updated once. A 200MB vendor directory doesn’t slow you down if you never check it out, and CI can do the same. Most developers on a project never touched <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> directly, and the cost of carrying all that third-party code was invisible to everyone who wasn’t actively updating it.</p>\n\n<p>Rails formalized the convention with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> for third-party code and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lib/</code> for your own.

          "summary": "Today's links The Nuremberg Caucus: What do Democrats have to lose? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Bradbury x LA monorails; Red Cross vs first aid kits; Wyden on CIA Senate spying; Coates x Sanders; Nerdy Valentines; Duke U, trademark troll; \"The Murder Next Door.\" Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The Nuremberg Caucus (permalink) America's descent into authoritarian fascism is made all the more alarming and demoralizing by the Democrats' total failure to rise to the moment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KADW3ZRZLVI But what would \"rising to the moment\" look like? What can the opposition party do without majorities in either house? Well, they could start by refusing to continue to fund ICE, a masked thug snatch/murder squad that roams our streets, killing with impunity: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273 That's table stakes. What would a real political response to fascism look like? Again, it wouldn't stop with banning masks for ICE goons, or even requiring them to wear QR codes: https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345 Though it should be noted that ICE hates this idea, and that ICE agents wear masks because they fear consequences for their sadistic criminality: https://archive.is/0LNh8 This despite the fact that the (criminally culpable) Vice President has assured them that they have absolute impunity, no matter who they kill: https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis The fact that ICE agents worry about consequences despite Vance's assurances suggests ways that Dems could \"meet the moment.\" I think Dems should start a Nuremberg Caucus, named for the Nazi war-crimes trials that followed from the defeat of German fascists and the death of their leader: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials What would this caucus do? Well, it could have a public website where it assembled and organized the evidence for the trials that the Democrats could promise to bring after the Trump regime falls. Each fresh outrage, each statement, each video-clip &#8211; whether of Trump officials or of his shock-troops &#8211; could be neatly slotted in, given an exhibit number, and annotated with the criminal and civil violations captured in the evidence. The caucus could publish dates these trials will be held on &#8211; following from Jan 20, 2029 &#8211; and even which courtrooms each official, high and low, will be tried in. These dates could be changed as new crimes emerge, making sure the most egregious offenses are always at the top of the agenda. Each trial would have a witness list. The Nuremberg Caucus could vow to repurpose ICE's $75b budget to pursue Trump's crimes, from corruption to civil rights violations to labor violations to environmental violations. It could announce its intent to fully fund the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division to undertake scrutiny of all mergers approved under Trump, and put corporations on notice that they should expect lengthy, probing inquiries into any mergers they undertake between now and the fall of Trumpism. Who knows, perhaps some shareholders will demand that management hold off on mergers in anticipation of this lookback scrutiny, and if not, perhaps they will sue executives after the FTC and DoJ go to work. While they're at it, the Nuremberg Caucus could publish a plan to hire thousands of IRS agents (paid for by taxing billionaires and zeroing out ICE's budget) who will focus exclusively on the ultra-wealthy and especially any supernormal wealth gains coinciding with the second Trump presidency. Money talks. ICE agents are signing up with the promise of $50k hiring bonuses and $60k in student debt cancellation. That's peanuts. The Nuremberg Caucus could announce a Crimestoppers-style program with $1m bounties for any ICE officer who a) is themselves innocent of any human rights violations, and; b) provides evidence leading to the conviction of another ICE officer for committing human rights violations. That would certainly improve morale for (some) ICE officers. Critics of this plan will say that this will force Trump officials to try to steal the next election in order to avoid consequences for their actions. This is certainly true: confidence in a \"peaceful transfer of power\" is the bedrock of any kind of fair election. But this bunch have already repeatedly signaled that they intend to steal the midterms and the next general election: https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html ICE agents are straight up telling people that ICE is on the streets to arrest people in Democratic-leaning states (\"The more people that you lose in Minnesota, you then lose a voting right to stay blue\"): https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/ The only path to fair elections &#8211; and saving America &#8211; lies through mobilizing and energizing hundreds of millions of Americans. They are ready. They are begging for leadership. They want an electoral choice, something better than a return to the pre-Trump status quo. If you want giant crowds at every polling place, rising up against ICE and DHS voter-suppression, then you have to promise people that their vote will mean something. Dems have to pick a side. That means being against anyone who is for fascism &#8211; including other Dems. The Nuremberg Caucus should denounce the disgusting child abuse perpetrated by the Trump regime: https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children But they should also denounce Democrats who vote to fund that abuse: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html The people of Minneapolis (and elsewhere) have repeatedly proven that we outnumber fascists by a huge margin. Dems need to stop demoralizing their base by doing nothing and start demonstrating that they understand the urgency of this crisis.
