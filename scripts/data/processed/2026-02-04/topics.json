Object permanence: DRM lobotomizes “human memory”; Crayola hex values; Tattoo artists copyright customers' bodies. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Michael Swanwick's \"The Universe Box\" (permalink) No one writes short stories like Michael Swanwick, the five-time Hugo-winning master of science fiction. To prove it, you need only pick up The Universe Box, Swanwick's just-published short story collection, a book representing one of the field's greatest writers at the absolute pinnacle of his game: https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/ Science fiction has a long and honorable history with the short story. Sf is a pulp literature that was born in the pages of magazines specializing in short fiction and serials, and long after other genres had given up the ghost, sf remained steadfastly rooted in short form fiction. There are still, to this day, multiple sf magazines that publish short stories every month, on paper, and pay for it. I started my career as a short story writer, and continue to dabble in the form, but I have mostly moved onto novels. That's a pretty common trajectory in sf, where &#8211; notwithstanding the field's status as a haven for the short story &#8211; the reach (and money) come from novels. But sf has always had a cohort of short fiction writers who are staunchly committed to the form: Harlan Ellison, Martha Soukup, Martha Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ted Chiang, James Tiptree Jr, Theodore Sturgeon, and, of course, Michael Swanwick. It's a little weird, how sf serves as a powerful redoubt for short fiction. After all, sf is a genre in which everything is up for grabs: the reader can't assume anything about the story's setting, its era, the species of its characters. Time can run forwards, backwards, or in a loop. There can be gods and teleporters, faster-than-light drives and superintelligent machines. There can be aliens and space colonies. All of that has to be established in the story. The most straightforward way to do this is, of course, through exposition. There's a commonplace (and wrong) notion that exposition is bad (\"show, don't tell\"). It's fairer to say that exposition is hard &#8211; dramatization is, well, dramatic, which makes it easier to engage the reader's attention. But great exposition is great and sf is a genre that celebrates exposition, done well: https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/ The opposite of exposition is what Jo Walton calls \"incluing,\" \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information\": https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html Incluing is a beautiful prose technique, but it makes the reader work. You have to pay close attention to all these subtle clues and build a web of inferences about the kind of world you've been plunged into. Incluing turns a story into a (wonderful and engaging) puzzle. It makes the aesthetic affect of short sf into something that's not so much a reverie as a high-engagement activity, a mystery whose solution is totally unbounded. This is a terrific experience, but it is also work. Doing that kind of work as part of the process of consuming a 300-page novel is one thing, but trying to get the reader up to speed in a 7,000 word story and still have room left over for the story part is a big lift, and even the best writers end up asking a lot of the reader in their short stories. Sf shorts can be the \"difficult jazz\" of literature, a form and genre that requires &#8211; and rewards &#8211; very active attention. (Incidentally, my favorite incluing example is Mark Twain's classic comedic short, \"The Petrified Man\":) https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/ But here's the thing. None of this applies to Swanwick. His stories use a mix of (impeccable) exposition and (subtle) incluing, and yet, there's never a moment in reading a Swanwick story where it feels like work. It's not merely that he's a gorgeous prose-smith whose sentences are each more surpassingly lovely than the last (though he is). Nor does he lack ambition: each of these stories has a more embroidered and outlandish premise than the last. Somehow, though, he just slides these stories into your brain. And what stories they are! They are, by turns, individually and in combination, slapstick, grave, horny, hilarious, surreal, disturbing and heartwarming. They have surprise endings and surprise middles and sometimes surprise beginnings (Swanwick does an opening paragraph like no one else). This is what it means to read a short story collection from an absolute master at the absolute peak of his powers. He can slide you frictionlessly between Icelandic troll tragedies to lethal drone-leopard romantic agonies to battles of the gods and the cigar box that has the universe inside of it. All with the lyricism of Bradbury, the madcap wit of Sturgeon, the unrelenting weirdness of Dick, the heart of Tiptree and the precision of Chiang. This is a book of worlds that each exist for just a handful of pages but occupy more space than those pages could possibly contain. It's a series of cigar boxes, each with the universe inside of it.

          "content": "<p>Back in the day, if you wandered into the parking area behind Building 11 on the original Redmond Microsoft campus, you would find a very large satellite dish antenna. This antenna was used for receiving video signals, such as cable television feeds for distribution to the Redmond campus. One purpose was to provide cable TV service for internal development and testing to teams like the Windows Media Center team and later the Xbox One team.</p>\n<p>The satellite dish antenna was a Simulsat-5 which was capable of gathering signals from 35 satellites simultaneously. (The record during this particular antenna&#8217;s lifetime was 26 simultaneous satellites.) It was a stationary antenna, not capable of changing its orientation. It went into service in 1997, was upgraded a few times, until it was finally decommissioned in 2017 when all of its tasks had been subsumed by a satellite dish antenna at the Studio C building.</p>\n<p>Fun trivial about the satellite dish antenna:</p>\n<p>In the summer, bees would nest in the feedbox (the thingie at focus of the satellite dish antenna that collected the signal), so you had to be careful when doing work there to avoid getting stung.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t fun in the winter either, because the enclosure for the electronic equipment (known as the &#8220;doghouse&#8221;) would get filled with spiders who enjoyed the warmth from the equipment.</p>\n<p>Snow had to be kept off the antenna for it to continue receiving signals, so whether or not Microsoft formally declared a snow closure, somebody had to remain on site to clear off the snow.</p>\n<p>In 2007, there was a mystery to be solved: Occasionally, there would be interference that disrupted the signal. After some investigation, it was discovered that the source was electromagnetic interference generated by the pressure washers that were used to clean the parking lot. The water connection port was at the rear of Building 11, right near the satellite dish antenna. The solution was to do",
