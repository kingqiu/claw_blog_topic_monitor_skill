A big part of that is proving to ourselves and to other people that the code we are responsible for behaves as expected.</p>\n<p>This becomes even more important - and challenging - as we embrace coding agents as a core part of our software development process.</p>\n<p>The more code we churn out with agents, the more valuable tools are that reduce the amount of manual QA time we need to spend.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting things about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/\">the StrongDM software factory model</a> is how they ensure that their software is well tested and delivers value despite their policy that \"code must not be reviewed by humans\". Part of their solution involves expensive swarms of QA agents running through \"scenarios\" to exercise their software. It's fascinating, but I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on QA robots if I can avoid it!</p>\n<p>I need tools that allow agents to clearly demonstrate their work to me, while minimizing the opportunities for them to cheat about what they've done.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"showboat-agents-build-documents-to-demo-their-work\">Showboat: Agents build documents to demo their work</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat\">Showboat</a></strong> is the tool I built to help agents demonstrate their work to me.</p>\n<p>It's a CLI tool (a Go binary, optionally <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/distributing-go-binaries/\">wrapped in Python</a> to make it easier to install) that helps an agent construct a Markdown document demonstrating exactly what their newly developed code can do.</p>\n<p>It's not designed for humans to run, but here's how you would run it anyway:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>showboat init demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>How to use curl and jq<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Here's how to use curl and jq together.<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\nshowboat <span class=\"pl-c1\">exec</span> demo.md bash <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat image demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Here's what the result looks like if you open it up in VS Code and preview the Markdown:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot showing a Markdown file &quot;demo.md&quot; side-by-side with its rendered preview. The Markdown source (left) shows: &quot;# How to use curl and jq&quot;, italic timestamp &quot;2026-02-10T01:12:30Z&quot;, prose &quot;Here's how to use curl and jq together.&quot;, a bash code block with &quot;curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description&quot;, output block showing '&quot;CLI tool for interacting with the web&quot;', text &quot;And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:&quot;, a bash {image} code block with &quot;curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png&quot;, and a Markdown image reference &quot;2056e48f-2026-02-10&quot;. The rendered preview (right) displays the formatted heading, timestamp, prose, styled code blocks, and the curl logo image in dark teal showing &quot;curl://&quot; with circuit-style design elements.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/curl-demo.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Here's that <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/fb0b24696ed8dd91314fe41f4c453563#file-demo-md\">demo.md file in a Gist</a>.</p>\n<p>So a sequence of <code>showboat init</code>, <code>showboat note</code>, <code>showboat exec</code> and <code>showboat image</code> commands constructs a Markdown document one section at a time, with the output of those <code>exec</code> commands automatically added to the document directly following the commands that were run.</p>\n<p>The <code>image</code> command is a little special - it looks for a file path to an image in the output of the command and copies that image to the current folder and references it in the file.</p>\n<p>That's basically the whole thing! There's a <code>pop</code> command to remove the most recently added section if something goes wrong, a <code>verify</code> command to re-run the document and check nothing has changed (I'm not entirely convinced by the design of that one) and a <code>extract</code> command that reverse-engineers the CLI commands that were used to create the document.</p>\n<p>It's pretty simple - just 172 lines of Go.</p>\n<p>I packaged it up with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">go-to-wheel</a> tool which means you can run it without even installing it first like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx showboat --help</pre></div>\n<p>That <code>--help</code> command is really important: it's designed to provide a coding agent with <em>everything it needs to know</em> in order to use the tool. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/main/help.txt\">that help text in full</a>.</p>\n<p>This means you can pop open Claude Code and tell it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run \"uvx showboat --help\" and then use showboat to create a demo.md document describing the feature you just built</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's it! The <code>--help</code> text acts <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/\">a bit like a Skill</a>. Your agent can read the help text and use every feature of Showboat to create a document that demonstrates whatever it is you need demonstrated.</p>\n<p>Here's a fun trick: if you set Claude off to build a Showboat document you can pop that open in VS Code and watch the preview pane update in real time as the agent runs through the demo. It's a bit like having your coworker talk you through their latest work in a screensharing session.</p>\n<p>And finally, some examples. Here are documents I had Claude create using Showboat to help demonstrate features I was working on in other projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/shot-scraper/README.md\">shot-scraper: A Comprehensive Demo</a> runs through the full suite of features of my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper</a> browser automation tool, mainly to exercise the <code>showboat image</code> command.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/cli.md\">sqlite-history-json CLI demo</a> demonstrates the CLI feature I added to my new <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json\">sqlite-history-json</a> Python library.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/row-state-sql.md\">row-state-sql CLI Demo</a> shows a new <code>row-state-sql</code> command I added to that same project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/change-grouping.md\">Change grouping with Notes</a> demonstrates another feature where groups of changes within the same transaction can have a note attached to them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/libkrun-go-cli-tool/demo.md\">krunsh: Pipe Shell Commands to an Ephemeral libkrun MicroVM</a> is a particularly convoluted example where I managed to get Claude Code for web to run a libkrun microVM inside a QEMU emulated Linux environment inside the Claude gVisor sandbox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've now used Showboat often enough that I've convinced myself of its utility.</p>\n<p>(I've also seen agents cheat! Since the demo file is Markdown the agent will sometimes edit that file directly rather than using Showboat, which could result in command outputs that don't reflect what actually happened. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/issues/12\">an issue about that</a>.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"rodney-cli-browser-automation-designed-to-work-with-showboat\">Rodney: CLI browser automation designed to work with Showboat</h4>\n<p>Many of the projects I work on involve web interfaces. Agents often build entirely new pages for these, and I want to see those represented in the demos.</p>\n<p>Showboat's image feature was designed to allow agents to capture screenshots as part of their demos, originally using my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper tool</a> or <a href=\"https://www.playwright.dev\">Playwright</a>.</p>\n<p>The Showboat format benefits from CLI utilities. I went looking for good options for managing a multi-turn browser session from a CLI and came up short, so I decided to try building something new.</p>\n<p>Claude Opus 4.6 pointed me to the <a href=\"https://github.com/go-rod/rod\">Rod</a> Go library for interacting with the Chrome DevTools protocol. It's fantastic - it provides a comprehensive wrapper across basically everything you can do with automated Chrome, all in a self-contained library that compiles to a few MBs.</p>\n<p>All Rod was missing was a CLI.</p>\n<p>I built the first version <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/go-rod-cli/README.md\">as an asynchronous report prototype</a>, which convinced me it was worth spinning out into its own project.</p>\n<p>I called it Rodney as a nod to the Rod library it builds on and a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses\">Only Fools and Horses</a> - and because the package name was available on PyPI.</p>\n<p>You can run Rodney using <code>uvx rodney</code> or install it like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv tool install rodney</pre></div>\n<p>(Or grab a Go binary <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/releases/\">from the releases page</a>.)</p>\n<p>Here's a simple example session:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>rodney start <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> starts Chrome in the background</span>\nrodney open https://datasette.io/\nrodney js <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney click <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>a[href=\"/for\"]<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney js location.href\nrodney js document.title\nrodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\nrodney stop</pre></div>\n<p>Here's what that looks like in the terminal:</p>\n<p><img alt=\";~ % rodney start\nChrome started (PID 91462)\nDebug URL: ws://127.0.0.1:64623/devtools/browser/cac6988e-8153-483b-80b9-1b75c611868d\n~ % rodney open https://datasette.io/\nDatasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data\n~ % rodney js 'Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)'\n[\n&quot;https://datasette.io/for&quot;,\n&quot;https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/tutorials&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/examples&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/plugins&quot;\n]\n~ % rodney click 'a[href=&quot;/for&quot;]'\nClicked\n~ % rodney js location.href\nhttps://datasette.io/for\n~ % rodney js document.title\nUse cases for Datasette\n~ % rodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\ndatasette-for-page.png\n~ % rodney stop\nChrome stopped\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/rodney-demo.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>As with Showboat, this tool is not designed to be used by humans! The goal is for coding agents to be able to run <code>rodney --help</code> and see everything they need to know to start using the tool. You can see <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/help.txt\">that help output</a> in the GitHub repo.</p>\n<p>Here are three demonstrations of Rodney that I created using Showboat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/rodney/README.md\">Rodney's original feature set</a>, including screenshots of pages and executing JavaScript.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/notes/accessibility-features/README.md\">Rodney's new accessibility testing features</a>, built during development of those features to show what they could do.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/datasette-database-page-accessibility-audit/README.md\">Using those features to run a basic accessibility audit of a page</a>. I was impressed at how well Claude Opus 4.6 responded to the prompt \"Use showboat and rodney to perform an accessibility audit of <a href=\"https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures\">https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures</a>\" - <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?dce6b2680db4b05c04469ed8f251eb34/index.html\">transcript here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"test-driven-development-helps-but-we-still-need-manual-testing\">Test-driven development helps, but we still need manual testing</h4>\n<p>After being a career-long skeptic of the test-first, maximum test coverage school of software development (I like <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/#tests\">tests included</a> development instead) I've recently come around to test-first processes as a way to force agents to write only the code that's necessary to solve the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>Many of my Python coding agent sessions start the same way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run the existing tests with \"uv run pytest\". Build using red/green TDD.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Telling the agents how to run the tests doubles as an indicator that tests on this project exist and matter. Agents will read existing tests before writing their own so having a clean test suite with good patterns makes it more likely they'll write good tests of their own.</p>\n<p>The frontier models all understand that \"red/green TDD\" means they should write the test first, run it and watch it fail and then write the code to make it pass - it's a convenient shortcut.</p>\n<p>I find this greatly increases the quality of the code and the likelihood that the agent will produce the right thing with the smallest amount of prompts to guide it.</p>\n<p>But anyone who's worked with tests will know that just because the automated tests pass doesn't mean the software actually works! That’s the motivation behind Showboat and Rodney - I never trust any feature until I’ve seen it running with my own eye.</p>\n<p>Before building Showboat I'd often add a “manual” testing step to my agent sessions, something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Once the tests pass, start a development server and exercise the new feature using curl</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"i-built-both-of-these-tools-on-my-phone\">I built both of these tools on my phone</h4>\n<p>Both Showboat and Rodney started life as Claude Code for web projects created via the Claude iPhone app. Most of the ongoing feature work for them happened in the same way.</p>\n<p>I'm still a little startled at how much of my coding work I get done on my phone now, but I'd estimate that the majority of code I ship to GitHub these days was written for me by coding agents driven via that iPhone app.</p>\n<p>I initially designed these two tools for use in asynchronous coding agent environments like Claude Code for the web. So far that's working out really well.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/go\">go</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/testing\">testing</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/markdown\">markdown</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/async-coding-agents\">async-coding-agents</a></p>",

          "summary": "<p>The most shameful thing I did in the workplace was lie to a colleague. It was about ten years ago, I was a fresh-faced intern, and in the rush to deliver something I’d skipped the step of testing my work in staging<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup>. It did not work. When deployed to production, it didn’t work there either. No big deal, in general terms: the page we were working on wasn’t yet customer-facing. But my colleague asked me over his desk whether this worked when I’d tested it, and I said something like “it sure did, no idea what happened”.</p>\n<p>I bet he forgot about it immediately. I could have just messed up the testing (for instance, by accidentally running some different code than the code I pushed), or he knew I’d probably lied, and didn’t really care. I haven’t forgotten about it. Even a decade later, I’m still ashamed to write it down.</p>\n<p>Of course I’m not ashamed about the <em>mistake</em>. I was sloppy to not test my work, but I’ve cut corners since then when I felt it was necessary, and I stand by that decision. I’m ashamed about how I handled it. But even that I understand. I was a kid, trying to learn quickly and prove I belonged in tech. The last thing I wanted to do was to dwell on the way I screwed up. If I were in my colleague’s shoes now, I’d have brushed it off too<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup>. How do I try to handle mistakes now?</p>\n<h3>Handling the emotional reaction</h3>\n<p>The most important thing is to <strong>control your emotions</strong>. If you’re anything like me, your strongest emotional reactions at work will be reserved for the times you’ve screwed up. There are usually two countervailing emotions at play here: the desire to defend yourself, find excuses, and minimize the consequences; and the desire to confess your guilt, abase yourself, and beg for forgiveness. Both of these are traps. </p>\n<p>Obviously making excuses for yourself (or flat-out denying the mistake, like I did) is bad. But going in the other direction and publicly beating yourself up about it is <em>just as bad</em>. It’s bad for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>First, you’re effectively asking the people around you to take the time and effort to reassure you, when they should be focused on the problem. Second, you’re taking yourself out of the group of people who are focused on the problem, when often you’re the best situated to figure out what to do: since it’s your mistake, you have the most context. Third, it’s just not professional. </p>\n<p>So what should you do? <strong>For the first little while, <em>do nothing</em>.</strong> Emotional reactions fade over time. Try and just ride out the initial jolt of realizing you screwed up, and the impulse to leap into action to fix it. Most of the worst reactions to screwing up happen in the immediate aftermath, so if you can simply do nothing during that period you’re already off to a good start. For me, this takes about thirty seconds. How much time you’ll need depends on you, but hopefully it’s under ten minutes. More than that and you might need to grit your teeth and work through it.</p>\n<h3>Communicate</h3>\n<p>Once you’re confident you’re under control, the next step is to <strong>tell people what happened</strong>. Typically you want to tell your manager, but depending on the problem it could also be a colleague or someone else. It’s really important here to be matter-of-fact about it, or you risk falling into the “I’m so terrible, please reassure me” trap I discussed above. You often don’t even need to explicitly say “I made a mistake”, if it’s obvious from context. Just say “I deployed a change and it’s broken X feature” (or whatever the problem is).</p>\n<p>You should do this <em>before</em> you’ve come up with a solution. It’s tempting to try to conceal your mistake and just quietly solve it. But for user-facing mistakes, concealment is impossible - somebody will raise a ticket eventually - and if you don’t communicate the issue, you risk someone else discovering it and independently raising it.</p>\n<p>In the worst case, while you’re quietly working on a fix, you’ll discover that somebody else has declared an incident. Of course, you understand the problem perfectly (since you caused it), and you know that it was caused by a bad deploy and is easily fixable. But the other people on the incident call don’t know all that. They’re thinking about the worst-case scenarios, wondering if it’s database or network-related, paging in all kinds of teams, causing all kinds of hassle. All of that could have been avoided if you had reported the issue immediately.</p>\n<p>In my experience, tech company managers will forgive mistakes<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup>, but <strong>they won’t forgive being made to look like a fool</strong>. In particular, they won’t forgive being deprived of critical information. If they’re asked to explain the incident by their boss, and they have to flounder around because they lack the context <em>that you had all along</em>, that may harm your relationship with them for good. On the other hand, if you give them a clear summary of the problem right away, and they’re able to seem like they’re on top of things to their manager, you <em>might</em> even earn credit for the situation (despite having caused it with your initial mistake).</p>\n<h3>Accept that it’s going to hurt</h3>\n<p>However, you probably won’t earn credit. This is where I diverge from the popular software engineering wisdom that incidents are always the fault of systems, never of individuals. Of course incidents are caused by the interactions of complex systems. Everything in the universe is caused by the interactions of complex systems! But one cause in that chain is often <em>somebody screwing up</em><sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>If you’re a manager of an engineering organization, and you want a project to succeed, you probably have a mental shortlist of the engineers in your org who can reliably lead projects<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-5\">5</a></sup>. If an engineer screws up repeatedly, they’re likely to drop off that list (or at least get an asterisk next to their name).</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter if you had a good technical reason to make the mistake, or if it’s excusable. Managers don’t care about that stuff, because they simply don’t have the technical context to know if it’s true or if you’re just trying to talk your way out of it. What managers do have the context to evaluate is <em>results</em>, so that’s what they judge you on.

It did not work. When deployed to production, it didn’t work there either. No big deal, in general terms: the page we were working on wasn’t yet customer-facing.

If you’re anything like me, your strongest emotional reactions at work will be reserved for the times you’ve screwed up. There are usually two countervailing emotions at play here: the desire to defend yourself, find excuses, and minimize the consequences; and the desire to confess your guilt, abase yourself, and beg for forgiveness. Both of these are traps. </p>\n<p>Obviously making excuses for yourself (or flat-out den",

          "content": "<p>Whilst I was implementing a <a href=\"https://github.com/git-pkgs/git-pkgs/pull/98\">vendor command in git-pkgs</a>, I noticed that not many package manager clients have native vendoring commands. Go has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">go mod vendor</code>, Cargo has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cargo vendor</code>, and Bundler has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bundle cache</code>. That’s most of the first-class support I could find, which surprised me for something that used to be the dominant way to manage dependencies. So I went looking for what happened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vendoring-under-svn\">Vendoring under SVN</h3>\n\n<p>Before lockfiles and registries, if you wanted reproducible builds you checked your dependencies into source control. The alternative was hoping the internet served you the same bytes tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Under Subversion this worked fine. SVN checkouts only pull the current revision of the directories you ask for, leaving everything else on the server. You never download previous versions of vendored files, so a dependency updated twenty times costs you the same as one updated once. A 200MB vendor directory doesn’t slow you down if you never check it out, and CI can do the same. Most developers on a project never touched <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> directly, and the cost of carrying all that third-party code was invisible to everyone who wasn’t actively updating it.</p>\n\n<p>Rails formalized the convention with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> for third-party code and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lib/</code> for your own.

Object permanence: Bradbury x LA monorails; Red Cross vs first aid kits; Wyden on CIA Senate spying; Coates x Sanders; Nerdy Valentines; Duke U, trademark troll; \"The Murder Next Door.\" Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The Nuremberg Caucus (permalink) America's descent into authoritarian fascism is made all the more alarming and demoralizing by the Democrats' total failure to rise to the moment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KADW3ZRZLVI But what would \"rising to the moment\" look like? What can the opposition party do without majorities in either house? Well, they could start by refusing to continue to fund ICE, a masked thug snatch/murder squad that roams our streets, killing with impunity: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273 That's table stakes. What would a real political response to fascism look like? Again, it wouldn't stop with banning masks for ICE goons, or even requiring them to wear QR codes: https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345 Though it should be noted that ICE hates this idea, and that ICE agents wear masks because they fear consequences for their sadistic criminality: https://archive.is/0LNh8 This despite the fact that the (criminally culpable) Vice President has assured them that they have absolute impunity, no matter who they kill: https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis The fact that ICE agents worry about consequences despite Vance's assurances suggests ways that Dems could \"meet the moment.\" I think Dems should start a Nuremberg Caucus, named for the Nazi war-crimes trials that followed from the defeat of German fascists and the death of their leader: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials What would this caucus do? Well, it could have a public website where it assembled and organized the evidence for the trials that the Democrats could promise to bring after the Trump regime falls. Each fresh outrage, each statement, each video-clip &#8211; whether of Trump officials or of his shock-troops &#8211; could be neatly slotted in, given an exhibit number, and annotated with the criminal and civil violations captured in the evidence. The caucus could publish dates these trials will be held on &#8211; following from Jan 20, 2029 &#8211; and even which courtrooms each official, high and low, will be tried in. These dates could be changed as new crimes emerge, making sure the most egregious offenses are always at the top of the agenda. Each trial would have a witness list. The Nuremberg Caucus could vow to repurpose ICE's $75b budget to pursue Trump's crimes, from corruption to civil rights violations to labor violations to environmental violations. It could announce its intent to fully fund the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division to undertake scrutiny of all mergers approved under Trump, and put corporations on notice that they should expect lengthy, probing inquiries into any mergers they undertake between now and the fall of Trumpism. Who knows, perhaps some shareholders will demand that management hold off on mergers in anticipation of this lookback scrutiny, and if not, perhaps they will sue executives after the FTC and DoJ go to work. While they're at it, the Nuremberg Caucus could publish a plan to hire thousands of IRS agents (paid for by taxing billionaires and zeroing out ICE's budget) who will focus exclusively on the ultra-wealthy and especially any supernormal wealth gains coinciding with the second Trump presidency. Money talks. ICE agents are signing up with the promise of $50k hiring bonuses and $60k in student debt cancellation. That's peanuts. The Nuremberg Caucus could announce a Crimestoppers-style program with $1m bounties for any ICE officer who a) is themselves innocent of any human rights violations, and; b) provides evidence leading to the conviction of another ICE officer for committing human rights violations. That would certainly improve morale for (some) ICE officers. Critics of this plan will say that this will force Trump officials to try to steal the next election in order to avoid consequences for their actions. This is certainly true: confidence in a \"peaceful transfer of power\" is the bedrock of any kind of fair election. But this bunch have already repeatedly signaled that they intend to steal the midterms and the next general election: https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html ICE agents are straight up telling people that ICE is on the streets to arrest people in Democratic-leaning states (\"The more people that you lose in Minnesota, you then lose a voting right to stay blue\"): https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/ The only path to fair elections &#8211; and saving America &#8211; lies through mobilizing and energizing hundreds of millions of Americans. They are ready. They are begging for leadership. They want an electoral choice, something better than a return to the pre-Trump status quo. If you want giant crowds at every polling place, rising up against ICE and DHS voter-suppression, then you have to promise people that their vote will mean something. Dems have to pick a side. That means being against anyone who is for fascism &#8211; including other Dems. The Nuremberg Caucus should denounce the disgusting child abuse perpetrated by the Trump regime: https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children But they should also denounce Democrats who vote to fund that abuse: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html The people of Minneapolis (and elsewhere) have repeatedly proven that we outnumber fascists by a huge margin. Dems need to stop demoralizing their base by doing nothing and start demonstrating that they understand the urgency of this crisis.

I don&#8217;t know whether he got to talk to the actors directly, or only to their agents, but I can imagine it being an interesting experience trying to find Henry Winkler&#8217;s ",
